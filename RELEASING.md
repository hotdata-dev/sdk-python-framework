# Releasing

Every release uses `./scripts/release.sh`. Do not bump versions, tag, or create GitHub Releases manually.

## One-time setup

- Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) and authenticate.
- Ensure PyPI [trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) is configured for this repo (`publish.yml` uses the `pypi` GitHub environment).

## Release steps

1. Add user-facing notes under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Prepare the release PR:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh prepare patch   # or minor | major | 1.2.3
   ```

3. Merge the PR after CI passes (including the changelog check).
4. Publish from a clean default branch checkout:

   ```bash
   git checkout main   # or master for hotdata-marimo
   git pull
   ./scripts/release.sh publish
   ```

## What happens automatically

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers two workflows:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `publish.yml` | Build wheel/sdist and publish to PyPI |
| `release.yml` | Create the GitHub Release with notes from `CHANGELOG.md` |

## Enforcement

- **PR check** (`check-release.yml`): if `pyproject.toml` version changes, `CHANGELOG.md` must contain a matching `## [X.Y.Z]` section.
- **Tag check** (`publish.yml`): the tag (without `v`) must match `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Publish guard** (`release.sh publish`): refuses to tag if the changelog section is missing.

Together, these make it hard to ship a version without changelog notes or a GitHub Release.
